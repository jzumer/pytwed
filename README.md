# Time Warped Edit Distance

This is a python wrapper for Marteau's implementation of this 2009 paper introducing TWED [1] (slightly modified and provided here). TWED is an elastic distance metric for comparing time series sequences that has been shown to be a promising contender the popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In comparision to DTW, it is a proper metric, which DTW is not, as it violates the triangle inequality. Similar to DTW, TWED has a time complexity of O(mn), where, m and n are the lengths of the time series sequences that are compared. This means it may not be appropriate for very large sequences and large time series databases. However, the fulfillment of the metric properties do allow for using some established speed-up tricks in down-stream algorithms that can compensate for the complexity. 

## Install

### Using pip

The module can be installed by running the following command in the directory with the In the path of `setup.py`

```bash
pip install .
```

### Using build script

The `example_build.sh` provides an exemplary command to build the sources without pip. 

## Usage

The module can then be loaded and directly used as follows:

```python
import pytwed
import numpy as np

seq1 = np.array([[1.0], [2.1], [3.2], [4.3], [5.4]]).astype('float64')
seq2 = np.array([[9.8], [7.6], [6.5], [4.3], [2.1]]).astype('float64')
ts1 = np.array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.]).astype('float64')
ts2 = ts1.copy()
pytwed.twed(seq1, seq2, ts1, ts2, gamma = 0.001, lmbda = 1.0, degree = 2)
```

Sequences `seq1` and `seq2` should of type `numpy.array` with shapes (m, d) and (n, d), where m and n are the lengths of the sequence and d is the dimensionality of the time sequences. The TWED should be provided with time stamps `ts1` and `ts2` with type `numpy.array`. For equally spaced sequences, they may be set to `ts1=np.arange(len(seq1))` and `ts2=np.arange(len(seq2))`. 

The distance function has three parameters that can be chosen/tuned. Degree refers to the $L^p$ norm that induces the distance calculation for individual elements. For `degree=2` the Euclidean norm is used and it is a useful default. Parameter `gamma` (should be > 0, default: 0.001) is a non-negative constant which characterizes the _stiffness_ of the elastic TWED measure. Parameter `lmbda` (should be >= 0, default: 1.0) is a constant penalty that punishes the editing efforts. The parameters should be tuned for each individual problem and dataset using training data minimizing your task's objective on a hold-out set. Grids to try are for instance `gamma in [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1]` and `lmbda in [0, .25, .5, .75, 1.0]` (see [1] for more details).

## Liability

We are providing the the code "as is" withouth a without warranty of any kind, with the hope that it can be useful to someone, without maintenance goals.
